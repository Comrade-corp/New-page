# New-page
just a new page
put this install folder that you download into my files and it *should* work correctly ( ͡°⏠ ͡°)
if favicon sponser page and back to home not working then change the links. 
--for favicon: go to chromem then hit ctrl + o find the folder with the files and open the png, put the png to replace the link that will have somthing to tell you its the favicon.--
do the same things for the tags to different games and such so you can properly launch them.
for the back to page on the sponser message you need to open the main page and get its link then you can put that in the allocated spot ⎝๏ ͜つ๏⎠
