## customization
***
This page is intended for you the downlaoder to customize which is why the images are replaced with blank pngs and all links #'d and Æ'd out. 
I Have an intuived and user friendly setup for customizing the links. #'s represent links and Æ's represent the text displayed for them! Easy all you need to do is
type each Æ with the wanted text, and each # for the link.
steps:
find "newpage.html" open it in txt if on chromebook(default) on windows open with notepad (or other text/code editor.) and edit the things shown above.
